# Tetration
The often known mathematical operations are addition(+), mulitplication(*), and exponentiation(^). The next one in line is tetration, where b tet a = a^(a^(a^a))... n times. This can also be expressed as a↑↑b using Knuth's up-arrow notation.

See [3blue1brown's video](https://youtu.be/elQVZLLiod4) for what this operation represents, and why, for some numbers, b-> infinity will not lead to divergence.
